# Basic-Particle-simulator
This is a basic particle simulator. Here I simulate two moving particles. It is my first project so, the quality of code is not appropriate, but still it is one of my favourite project.

## Code
There is a Jupyter notebook which when executed should produce a video in which two particles should move.

## Result
The output of this code will be a video. It can be directly viewed using the link [Video Link](https://github.com/adarshkashyap15/Basic-Particle-simulator/blob/main/output_movie.mp4).
